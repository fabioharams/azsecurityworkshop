# Security Workshop | Azure
This workshop contains instructions to test resources on Azure like:
- Application Gateway
- Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Log Analytics
- Azure Security Center
- Azure Sentinel
- Network Watcher

To test this scenario a virtual machine running UBUNTU with DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) will be used to test vulnerabilities.
